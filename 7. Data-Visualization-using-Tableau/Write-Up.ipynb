    "## Suggestions from First Review:\n",
    "\n",
    "*It's abundantly clear that you've put a great deal of effort, time, and thought into all aspect of this project. The quality shows, and I've really enjoyed reviewing your project. They are just a couple of areas that still need your attention and can still be improved on. Please consider these points:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- *\"Great job of grouping the players when plotting batting average by home run count. This shows a good intuition for choosing the most appropriate analytical tools.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *\"Although you make it quite clear with the text in the captions and the text within the dashboard what each chart is about, **a descriptive title for each chart is considered best practice**. In my experience, people almost automatically look for a title in the upper margin of a chart to help get an idea of what's being plotted. You can leverage this by choosing a short, concise title for each chart.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Changes:** I have now added the captions to each plot. This is a very important feedback and the reason I removed in the first place was to give the plots more space to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *\"You've got a lot of slide and information here. It needs to be boiled down more. **Some of your slides present the same data in slightly different plots**. For example, the fifth and sixth slides have very similar plots on the same variables. Please think about how you can condense your project down to fewer slides and charts.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Changes:** The fifth plot is removed from the story line. This is something I mentioned before I submitted my project and as rightly pointed out by the instructor, there are some plots, though different in structure, sort of iterates on the same idea. There are two reasons behind it:\n",
    "        - First, this project gave me a huge opportunity to learn the various ways you can present the data or an idea, so tried to showcase the ones I really found interesting.\n",
    "        - Second, as suggested about the fifth and sixth slides, the fifth slide is a combination of both sixth and seventh slides and was added to the story to give a quick overview of the detailed presentation of the next two plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *\"Some of the **trend lines that you've plotted are very faint and barely noticeable**. Please make the trend lines more visible by choosing a darker color or increasing the opaqueness.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Changes:** The color of trend and reference lines are now visibly better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *\"Great job on including (and explaining!) BMI and including it in your analysis as a calculated field. Good work! On the slide with the BMI charts the **difference between the two shades of blue is almost unnoticeable**. Please choose colors that are more constrastive so the difference between the batting average bars in the plot and the home run count bars is more clear.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Changes:** The color codings are changed to more contrasting nature."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "“Baseball Data” was chosen as the dataset for Tableau’s final project. It contains the following information on 1157 baseball players:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tThe handedness (right, left or both handed)\n",
    "-\tHeight (in inches)\n",
    "-\tWeight (in pounds)\n",
    "-\tBatting average\n",
    "-\tHome runs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, through data analysis and visualizations we shall try to understand the relationship between a players' physical attributes and performance."

  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "## Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Exploration:\n",
    "I started with minor editing of the data in the downloaded csv file “baseball_data.csv”:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tExcept for the “HR” column, changing all the column names’ first letter to capital.\n",
    "-\tReplacing the ‘B’, ‘L’ & ‘R’ initials under the “Handedness” column to “Both”, “Left” & “Right” respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: All of the above could have been done in the Tableau itself, but for some reason, the edited names in the project weren’t recognized once the project was closed and re-opened again, there were duplication of the column names from the original file.)\n",
    "\n",
    "With my idea on baseball a bit limited, I did a quick read online to gather basic knowledge on batting average and home runs.\n",
    "Going through the data in the file, I found that out of 1157 data:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\t20 players have 0 for home run where as their batting average is more than that.\n",
    "-\tAlso, when I was cross-checking a couple of player’s profile I came across the player Tom Brown who has a 0 for both home run and batting average but his Wikipedia page shows 0.147 and 1 for batting average and home run respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above two instances led to me believe that there’s a good chance we might be missing some crucial data on the players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analysis & Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "For analysis purposes, we have two separate attributes to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Physical attribute: Height, Weight, Handedness\n",
    "- Performance attribute: Batting Average, Home Run\n",
    "\n",
    "We compare each physical component to a separate performance parameter, like height vs. batting average, weight vs. home run etc., to give us a better look at what aspect has the most influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we mix up the physical attributes to further analyze the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the no. of plots and visualizations I went through to come up with my final story:\n",

    "### FINDINGS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick summary on the findings based on handedness, height and weight:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HANDEDNESS**: Most of the players are right handed (at 737) followed by left handed (at 316) and both handed (at 104) players.\n",

    "        - For average home run: Both < Right < Left\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HEIGHT**: Players are divided into three groups for height:\n",

    "    - 72 to 74 inches\n",
    "    - 75 to 80 inches\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Most of the players are in the 72 to 74 group (at 606) followed by group 65 to 71 (at 316) and 75 to 80 (at 235).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Group 65 to 71 has the **highest mean batting average at 0.22** but have an average home run of 41.10.\n",

    "## Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "I started out thinking to have simple & effective visualizations of the data. Initially I had about 12 plots, with 4 dashboards and 1 story page. There was an overflow of feedbacks from my two good friends for the initial design and in addition to the ones given above, here are some general feedbacks on the graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to follow and understand the data, but someone with basic or no idea on baseball might find it hard to follow.\n",
    "- The visualizations are good but not very eye-catching.\n",
    "- You need to describe a finding a bit more in detail.\n",
    "- Should take more advantage of the various kinds of plots that comes with tableau.\n",
    "- To combine two or more different plots into one for better comparision.\n",
    "- Adjust scales on some plots.\n",
    "- If possible try removing the background grid lines wherever not necessary.\n",
    "- Have better and a standard naming convention throughout the project.\n",
    "- Better labels for the graphs.\n",
    "- Try adding some more plots.\n",
    "- There are some repetitions in your plots.\n",
    "- Why not remove the graphs, you don't end up using on your dashboards and story.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "All the feedbacks were very crucial in improving the final design. To of the feedbacks, I was a bit reluctant to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may find some plots in the final story that iterates on the same idea and the reason behind it is, not only I'm trying to convey my findings but also give the reader a chance to get more involved with the data and the visualizations, if they wish to do so.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- I didn't remove any graphs that didn't end up on the final story, as plotting graphs for every possible scenario helped me a lot to understand the data better and also gave me an indication if a plot was crucial enough to deliver an idea at the end."
